Organic tangerine peel extracts are derived from tangerines grown without the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, making them highly popular among consumers who prioritize natural and eco-friendly products. These extracts are rich in antioxidants, flavonoids, and essential oils, contributing to their increasing use in the food and beverage, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries. The demand for organic extracts is expected to grow as more consumers adopt sustainable and health-conscious lifestyles, particularly in urban areas of Germany where wellness trends are gaining momentum. On the other hand, conventional tangerine peel extracts, which are sourced from tangerines grown with the aid of traditional farming methods, continue to hold a significant market share. These extracts are more cost-effective and widely available, making them a preferred option for many manufacturers, especially in the food industry. Conventional tangerine peel extracts are utilized in a variety of applications, from flavoring agents in food products to natural additives in cosmetics and personal care items.
